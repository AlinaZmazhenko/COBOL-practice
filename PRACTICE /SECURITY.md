# üîê Security Considerations ‚Äî SecureBank COBOL

This document outlines the primary security risks addressed in the SecureBank COBOL project and the basic mitigation techniques implemented. While the COBOL language was not originally designed with cybersecurity in mind, this project illustrates how structured security principles can be applied even within legacy system logic.

## üõë Threats Addressed

### 1. Weak Authentication
Legacy COBOL systems often lack account lockout mechanisms or password controls. In this project:
- Login attempts are limited to 3.
- Incorrect credentials trigger account blocking.
- Authentication is implemented as a basic line of defense.

### 2. Input Injection
Many COBOL applications lack input validation, making them vulnerable to malformed input or logic manipulation. This project:
- Rejects potentially dangerous characters like `;`, `--`, `*`, `DROP`.
- Flags suspicious input before processing numeric values.

### 3. Excessive Transaction Amounts
Older systems may not have hard-coded financial transaction limits. SecureBank:
- Rejects transactions above $10,000.
- Logs every approved or denied attempt.

### 4. Lack of Audit Trails
Legacy systems may not provide user-level event logs. This module:
- Generates a timestamped log for each user action.
- Logs include username, date, and action description.

## üß± Limitations

- No encryption (COBOL has no native support).
- No user role control or multi-factor authentication.
- Simulated security model within single-threaded logic.

## üîß Recommendations for Extension

- Integrate external authentication services via middleware
- Move logs to external SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk or Elastic)
- Implement hashed password storage (via JCL or DB2 interface)
- Use COBOL + CICS + RACF for enterprise-level security

## üìå Value to Legacy System Modernization

This project demonstrates a minimal viable implementation of security features in COBOL. It serves as a learning tool for developers, a teaching aid in cybersecurity courses, and a reference model for transitioning legacy systems toward compliance with modern security standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-53 or ISO/IEC 27001).

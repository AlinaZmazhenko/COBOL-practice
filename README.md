# COBOL PRACTICE MODULES

This repository contains a curated collection of COBOL practice programs designed to reinforce practical skills in legacy system development. Each module simulates a real-world task that may still exist in financial, administrative, or governmental systems operating on mainframes.

 Purpose

These examples are designed to help COBOL learners and professionals better understand business logic patterns, data handling structures, and the importance of secure programming techniques in legacy environments.

Cybersecurity Context

Although COBOL was not originally created with security in mind, legacy systems built on COBOL remain operational in many sectors and face growing cybersecurity risks. These exercises provide a foundation for recognizing how:
- insecure input handling,
- lack of transaction validation,
- and absence of logging

can expose critical systems to vulnerabilities.

Some examples in this repository (e.g., `PAYROLL`, `DATE VALIDATION`, `VOTING`) highlight common weak points in user input and business logic, serving as the basis for modernizing code with defensive programming principles.

Structure

Each subfolder represents a separate COBOL module with an individual `.cbl` source file. Most modules can be compiled using GnuCOBOL and run in a command-line environment.
